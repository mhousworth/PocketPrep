          "19": "Immediately dip the bottom of the saucepan in a large bowl of ice water for a few seconds to stop the cooking.",
          "20": "Transfer the caramel to a liquid measuring cup and cool slightly (it should still be liquid). Be careful-the caramel will still be hot!",
          "21": "Draw a 7-inch circle on parchment paper. Partially dip each filled puff into the caramel and let the excess drip off. Arrange the puffs around the circle. If the caramel hardens, microwave until soft, 45 seconds.",
          "22": "Fill the base circle with more puffs for stability, then continue building a conical tower of smaller circles. Top the tower with a single puff. Line your work surface with parchment paper-the next step can be messy.",
          "23": "Dip the tip of a fork into the caramel and quickly wave it in circles around the tower to create a web of caramel strands. Repeat. Let set, then slide two spatulas under the paper and transfer the croquembouche to a platter. Tear off the excess paper around the base.",
          "24": "To serve, crack the caramel web with the back of a knife, then dismantle the tower and transfer the cream puffs to plates."
